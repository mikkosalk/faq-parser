            "{'question': 'Question 1: What is a “trade or business” for purposes of the employee retention credit? ', 'answer': 'Answer 1: For purposes of the employee retention credit, “trade or business” has the same meaning as when used in section 162 of the Code other than the trade or business of performing services as an employee. Under section 162, an activity does not qualify as a trade or business unless its primary purpose is to make a profit and it is carried on with regularity and continuity. The facts and circumstances of each case determine whether an activity is a trade or business. A taxpayer does not necessarily need to make a profit in any particular year in order to be in a trade or business as long as a good faith profit motive is present. For purposes of the employee retention credit, a tax-exempt organization described in section 501(c) of the Code that is exempt from tax under section 501(a) of the Code is deemed to be engaged in a “trade or business” with respect to all operations of the organization. '}\n",
            "{'question': 'Question 2: How does an organization determine if it is considered an “instrumentality” of the Federal government, or of a State or local government, for purposes of the employee retention credit? ', 'answer': 'Answer 2: In general, for employment tax purposes, the IRS considers six factors in determining whether an organization is a government instrumentality. The six factors that are used to determine whether an organization is an instrumentality are: • whether the organization is used for a governmental purpose and performs a governmental function; • whether performance of the organization’s function is on behalf of one or more States or political subdivisions; • whether there are any private interests involved, or whether the States or political subdivisions involved have the powers and interests of an owner; • whether control and supervision of the organization is vested in a public authority or authorities; • if express or implied statutory or other authority is necessary for the creation and/or use of such an instrumentality, and whether such authority exists; and • the degree of financial autonomy and the source of its operating expenses. See Rev. Rul. 57-128, 1957-1 C.B. 311. No one factor is determinative; instrumentality status is based on all the facts and circumstances. These same factors apply to identify an instrumentality of the Federal government, or of a State or local government, for purposes of the employee retention credit. '}\n",
            "{'question': 'Question 3: Are tribal governments and tribal entities eligible for the employee retention credit? ', 'answer': 'Answer 3: Yes. Any tribal government or tribal entity that operates a trade or business may be an eligible employer for purposes of the employee retention credit if it otherwise satisfies the eligibility requirements to claim the credit. As a general rule, whether activities constitute a trade or business for purposes of the employee retention credit is determined under section 162 of the Code. However, because tribal governments are not subject to income tax under the Code and, therefore, are generally not otherwise required to determine whether an activity of the tribe constitutes the carrying on of a trade or business under section 162, the Treasury Department and IRS have concluded that the section 162 standards are not the appropriate bases for determining whether a tribal government is carrying on a trade or business for purposes of the employee retention credit. Instead, solely for purposes of the employee retention credit, a tribal government is treated as carrying on trade or business activities, and all activities conducted by the tribal government will be considered part of such trade or business activities, without the need for further analysis of whether those activities meet a particular standard for identifying trade or business operations. In addition, solely for purposes of the employee retention credit, any entity that a tribal government reasonably believes shares the same tax status as the tribal government (tribal entity employer) may also consider all of its activities as trade or business activities. Any entity other than a tribal government or a tribal entity employer must determine whether its activities constitute carrying on a trade or business under section 162 for purposes of determining eligibility for the employee retention credit. '}\n",
            "{'question': 'Question 4: Are employers in U.S. Territories eligible for the employee retention credit? ', 'answer': 'Answer 4: Yes. If an employer in a U.S. Territory otherwise qualifies for the employee retention credit then the employer is entitled to claim the credit. Section 2301(c)(5)(A) of the CARES Act provides that qualified wages are, in general, wages as defined in section 3121(a) of the Code for purposes of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax. Payments of wages by employers in U.S. Territories are wages within the meaning of section 3121(a). Accordingly, eligible employers include employers in the U.S. Territories that pay qualified wages and otherwise meet the requirements for the credit. '}\n",
            "{'question': 'Question 5: Are self-employed individuals eligible for the employee retention credit? ', 'answer': 'Answer 5: Self-employed individuals are not eligible for the employee retention credit with respect to their own self-employment earnings. However, a self-employed individual who employs other individuals in the self-employed individual’s trade or business and who otherwise meets the requirements to be an eligible employer may be eligible for the employee retention credit with respect to qualified wages the self-employed individual pays to the employees. '}\n",
            "{'question': 'Question 6: Are household employers eligible for the employee retention credit? ', 'answer': 'Answer 6: No. Household employers are not considered to operate a trade or business and, therefore, are not eligible for the employee retention credit with respect to their household employees. However, household employers who are also employers operating a trade or business and who generally report employment taxes attributable to their household employees on the same federal employment tax return used to report the employment taxes attributable to the employees of the trade or business, may be eligible for the employee retention credit, but only with respect to the trade or business employees and their qualified wages paid with respect to the trade or business. B. Aggregation Rules '}\n",
            "{'question': 'Question 7: What is the general impact of the aggregation rules that treat certain entities as a single employer? ', 'answer': 'Answer 7: All entities that are members of a controlled group of corporations or trades or businesses under common control under sections 52(a) or (b) of the Code, members of an affiliated service group under section 414(m) of the Code, or otherwise aggregated under section 414(o) of the Code are treated as a single employer for purposes of applying the employee retention credit. As a result, employers required to be aggregated are treated as a single employer for purposes of the following rules applicable to the employee retention credit: • Determining whether the employer has a trade or business operation that was fully or partially suspended due to orders related to COVID-19 from an appropriate governmental authority; • Determining whether the employer experiences a significant decline in gross receipts; • Determining whether the employer averaged more than 100 full-time employees; and • Determining the maximum credit amount per employee. The aggregation rules under section 52(a) and (b) generally apply to determine which entities are treated as a single employer for purposes of the tax credits available to an employer under section 51 of the Code, as well as for other Code provisions. Under section 52(a), corporate taxpayers that are members of a controlled group of corporations are treated as a single employer. A controlled group of corporations may be either a parent-subsidiary controlled group, a brother-sister controlled group, or a combined group of corporations.13 The section 52(b) aggregation rules apply to 13 A parent-subsidiary controlled group of corporations is one or more chains of corporations where the common parent corporation owns more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote, or more than 50 percent of the value of all classes of stock of each corporation. A brother-sister controlled group of corporations is two or more corporations where (1) five partnerships, trusts, estates, corporations, or sole proprietorships in trades or businesses under common control. Under this rule, entities are treated as a single employer if they are under common control applying rules similar to the parent-subsidiary or brother-sister controlled group rules or the rules for a combined group of corporations. Section 414(m)(1) provides that employees of members in an affiliated service group under section 414(m)(2) and (5) are treated as employed by a single employer for purposes of employee benefit requirements listed in section 414(m)(4).14 In addition, section 414(o) generally provides that the Secretary shall prescribe regulations necessary to prevent avoidance of any of the employee benefit requirements listed in section 414(m)(4) through the use of separate organizations or other arrangements. Many Code provisions, particularly those addressing employee benefits, apply the aggregation rules of section 414(m) and (o). For example, section 414(t) generally or fewer persons who are individuals, estates, or trusts own at least 80 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote, or the total value of shares of all classes of stock of each corporation; and (2) the same five or fewer persons, taking into account ownership only to the extent that it is identical with respect to each corporation, own more than 50 percent of the total voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote, or total value of shares of all classes of stock of each corporation. A combined group of corporations is three or more corporations, each of which is a member of either a parent-subsidiary or a brother-sister controlled group, and at least one of which is both the common parent of a parent-subsidiary controlled group and also a member of a brother-sister controlled group. See Treas. Reg. § 1.52-1. 14 There are three types of affiliated service groups described in section 414(m). The first and second types of affiliated service groups are described under section 414(m)(2) and require a combination of common ownership and performance of services among certain organizations. The third type of affiliated service group is described under section 414(m)(5), requires no common ownership, and aggregates employers based on the performance of management functions by one organization for another organization (and related organizations). provides that the aggregation rules in section 414(m) and (o) apply to various Code provisions listed in section 414(t)(2). '}\n",
            "{'question': 'Question 8: How is the employee retention credit allocated to an eligible employer that is a member of an aggregated group? ', 'answer': \"Answer 8: The amount of the employee retention credit with respect to a member of the aggregated group is based on the member's proportionate share of the qualified wages giving rise to the credit for each calendar quarter (or other prescribed period for which a tax return is required to be filed) for which the credit is claimed. \"}\n",
            "{'question': 'Question 9: How do the aggregation rules apply to tribes and tribal entities? ', 'answer': 'Answer 9: In determining eligibility for the employee retention credit, all employers must apply the aggregation rules under section 52(a) and (b) and section 414(m) and (o) of the Code. For purposes of the employee retention credit, tribal governments and tribal entity employers (as defined in Q/A–3) should use a reasonable, good faith interpretation in determining how the aggregation rules apply. C. Governmental Orders '}\n",
            "{'question': 'Question 10: What “orders from an appropriate governmental authority” may be taken into account by an employer for purposes of determining eligibility for the employee retention credit? ', 'answer': 'Answer 10: Orders, proclamations, or decrees from the Federal government or any State or local government may be taken into account by an employer as “orders from an appropriate governmental authority” only if they limit “commerce, travel, or group meetings (for commercial, social, religious, or other purposes) due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)” and relate to the suspension of an employer’s operation of its trade or business. Orders that are not from the Federal government must be from a State or local government that has jurisdiction over the employer’s operations. These orders are referred to as “governmental orders.” Whether orders, proclamations or decrees are governmental orders is determined without regard to the level of enforcement of the governmental order. Statements from a governmental official, including comments made during press conferences or in interviews with the media, do not rise to the level of a governmental order for purposes of the employee retention credit. Additionally, the declaration of a state of emergency by a governmental authority is not sufficient to rise to the level of a governmental order if it does not limit commerce, travel, or group meetings in any manner. Further, such a declaration that limits commerce, travel, or group meetings, but does so in a manner that does not relate to the suspension of an employer’s operation of its trade or business does not rise to the level of a governmental order for purposes of the employer’s determination of its eligibility for the employee retention credit. Governmental orders include: • An order from the city’s mayor stating that all non-essential businesses must close for a specified period; • A State’s emergency proclamation that residents must shelter in place for a specified period, other than residents who are employed by an essential business and who may travel to and work at the workplace location; • An order from a local official imposing a curfew on residents that impacts the operating hours of a trade or business for a specified period; • An order from a local health department mandating a workplace closure for cleaning and disinfecting. Whether the operations of a trade or business are considered essential or non-essential will often vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. An employer should determine whether it is operating an essential or non-essential business by referring to the governmental order affecting the employer’s operation of its trade or business. Example 1: Governor of State Y issues an order that all non-essential businesses must close from March 20, 2020, until April 30, 2020. The order provides a list of non-essential businesses, including gyms, spas, nightclubs, barber shops, hair salons, tattoo parlors, physical therapy offices, waxing salons, fitness centers, bowling alleys, arcades, racetracks, indoor children’s play areas, theaters, chiropractors, planetariums, museums, and performing arts centers. The governor’s order is a governmental order limiting the operations of non-essential businesses; therefore, employers with non-essential businesses to which the governmental order applies may be considered eligible employers for purposes of the employee retention credit. Example 2: Mayor of City Y holds a press conference encouraging residents to practice social distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The statement during the press conference is not an order limiting commerce, travel, or group meetings. Accordingly, the mayor’s statement would not be a governmental order for purposes of the employee retention credit. Example 3: A restaurant is ordered by a local health department to close due to a health code violation. Since the order is unrelated to COVID-19, it would not be considered a governmental order for purposes of the employee retention credit. D. Full or Partial Suspension of Trade or Business Operations '}\n",
            "{'question': 'Question 11: If a governmental order requires non-essential businesses to suspend operations but allows essential businesses to continue operations, is an essential business considered to have a full or partial suspension of operations due to a governmental order? ', 'answer': 'Answer 11: An employer that operates an essential business is not considered to have a full or partial suspension of operations if the governmental order allows all of the employer’s operations to remain open. However, an employer that operates an essential business may be considered to have a partial suspension of operations if, under the facts and circumstances, more than a nominal portion of its business operations are suspended by a governmental order. For example, an employer that maintains both essential and non-essential business operations, each of which are more than nominal portions of the business operations, may be considered to have a partial suspension of its operations if a governmental order restricts the operations of the non-essential portion of the business, even if the essential portion of the business is unaffected. In addition, an essential business that is permitted to continue its operations may, nonetheless, be considered to have a partial suspension of its operations if a governmental order requires the business to close for a period of time during normal working hours. Solely for purposes of this employee retention credit, a portion of an employer’s business operations will be deemed to constitute more than a nominal portion of its business operations if either (i) the gross receipts from that portion of the business operations is not less than 10 percent of the total gross receipts (both determined using the gross receipts of the same calendar quarter in 2019), or (ii) the hours of service performed by employees in that portion of the business is not less than 10 percent of the total number of hours of service performed by all employees in the employer’s business (both determined using the number of hours of service performed by employees in the same calendar quarter in 2019). '}\n",
            "{'question': 'Question 12: If a governmental order causes the suppliers to a business to suspend their operations, is the business considered to have a suspension of operations due to a governmental order? ', 'answer': 'Answer 12: An employer may be considered to have a full or partial suspension of operations due to a governmental order if, under the facts and circumstances, the business’s suppliers are unable to make deliveries of critical goods or materials due to a governmental order that causes the supplier to suspend its operations. If the facts and circumstances indicate that the business’s operations are fully or partially suspended as a result of the inability to obtain critical goods or materials from its suppliers because they were required to suspend operations, then the business would be considered an eligible employer for calendar quarters during which its operations are fully or partially suspended and may be eligible to receive the employee retention credit. Example: Employer A operates an auto parts manufacturing business. Employer A’s supplier of raw materials is required to fully suspend its operations due to a governmental order. Employer A is unable to procure these raw materials from an alternate supplier. As a consequence of the suspension of Employer A’s supplier, Employer A is not able to perform its operations for a period of time. Under these facts and circumstances, Employer A would be considered an eligible employer during this period because its operations have been suspended due to the governmental order that suspended operations of its supplier. '}\n",
            "{'question': 'Question 13: If a governmental order causes the customers of a business to stay at home, or otherwise causes a reduction in demand for its products or services, and the business responds to the lack of demand by suspending some or all of its operations, is the business considered to have a suspension of operations due to a governmental order? ', 'answer': 'Answer 13: No. An employer that suspends some or all of its operations because its customers are subject to a government order requiring them to stay at home or otherwise causing a reduction in demand for its products or services is not considered to have a full or partial suspension of its operations due to a governmental order. If an employer’s operations are not suspended due to a governmental order but the employer experiences a reduction in demand, the employer may be considered an eligible employer if it experiences a significant decline in gross receipts. Example: Employer B, an automobile repair service business, is an essential business and is not required to close its locations or suspend its operations. Due to a governmental order that limits travel and requires members of the community to stay at home except for certain essential travel, such as going to the grocery store, Employer B’s business has declined significantly. Employer B suspends its operations due to the lack of demand. Employer B is not considered to have a full or partial suspension of operations due to a governmental order. '}\n",
            "{'question': 'Question 14: If an employer voluntarily suspends operation of a trade or business or voluntarily reduces hours due to COVID-19, but the suspension or reduction in hours is not due to a governmental order, may the employer qualify as an eligible employer solely on the basis of the voluntary suspension or reduction in hours? ', 'answer': 'Answer 14: No. An employer that voluntarily suspends operation of a trade or business or voluntarily reduces hours due to COVID-19 is not eligible for the employee retention credit on the basis of a full or partial suspension of its operations. '}\n",
            "{'question': 'Question 15: If a governmental order requires an employer to close its workplace, but the employer is able to continue operations comparable to its operations prior to the closure by requiring employees to telework, is the employer considered to have a suspension of operations? ', 'answer': 'Answer 15: No. If an employer’s workplace is closed by a governmental order, but the employer is able to continue operations comparable to its operations prior to the closure, including by requiring its employees to telework, the employer’s operations are not considered to have been fully or partially suspended as a consequence of a governmental order. However, if the closure of the workplace causes the employer to suspend business operations for certain purposes, but not others, it may be considered to have a partial suspension of operations due to the governmental order. Example 1: Employer C, a software development company, maintains an office in a city where the mayor has ordered that only essential businesses may operate. Employer C’s business is not essential under the mayor’s order, and therefore Employer C is required to close its office. Prior to the governmental order, all employees at the company teleworked once or twice per week, and business meetings were held at various locations. Following the governmental order, the company ordered mandatory telework for all employees and limited client meetings to telephone or video conferences. Employer C’s business operations are not considered to be fully or partially suspended due to the governmental order because the employer is able to continue its business operations in a comparable manner. Example 2: Employer D operates a physical therapy facility in a city where the mayor has ordered that only essential businesses may operate. Employer D’s business is not considered essential under the mayor’s order, and therefore Employer D is required to close its workplace. Prior to the governmental order, none of Employer D’s employees provided services through telework and all appointments, administration, and other duties were carried out at Employer D’s workplace. Following the governmental order, Employer D moves to an online format and is able to serve some clients remotely, but employees cannot access specific equipment or tools that they typically use in therapy and not all clients can be served remotely. Employer D’s business operations are considered to be partially suspended due to the governmental order because Employer D’s workplace, including access to physical therapy equipment, is central to its operations, and the business operations cannot continue in a comparable manner. Example 3: Employer E, a scientific research company with facilities in a state in which the governor has ordered that only essential businesses may operate, conducts research in a laboratory setting and through the use of computer modeling. Employer E’s business is not essential under the governor’s order, and therefore Employer E is required to close its workplace. Prior to the governmental order, Employer E’s laboratory-based research operations could not be conducted remotely (other than certain related administrative tasks) and employees involved in laboratory-based research worked on-site. Employer E’s computer modeling research operations could be conducted remotely, and employees who engaged in this portion of the business often teleworked. Following the governmental order, the employees engaged in the laboratory-based research cannot perform their work while the facility is closed and are limited to performing administrative tasks during the closure. In contrast, all employees engaged in computer modeling research are directed to telework, and those business operations are able to continue in a comparable manner. Employer E’s business operations are considered to be partially suspended due to the governmental order because Employer E’s laboratory-based research business operations cannot continue in a comparable manner. '}\n",
            "{'question': 'Question 16: What factors should be considered in determining if an employer is able to continue operations comparable to its operations prior to closure such that the employer’s operations are not considered to have been fully or partially suspended due to a governmental order? ', 'answer': 'Answer 16: The following factors should be considered in determining if an employer is able to continue comparable operations, although additional factors may be considered as well if relevant: (1) Employer’s telework capabilities. Determine whether an employer has adequate support (IT and otherwise) such that operations can continue via work from another location. (2) Portability of employees’ work. Determine the amount of portable work, or work otherwise adaptable to be performed from a remote location, within an employer’s trade or business operations. (3) Need for presence in employee’s physical work space. Evaluate the role that the employer’s physical work space plays in an employer’s trade or business (may be critical and necessary, beneficial but not necessary, or merely convenient). If the employer’s physical work space is so critical to its trade or business operations that tasks central to the trade or business’s operations are unable to be performed remotely, then this factor alone indicates that the employer is not able to continue comparable operations. Examples of work space that is critical include laboratories or manufacturing involving special equipment or materials that cannot be accessed or operated remotely. (4) Transitioning to telework operations. If an employer can conduct comparable operations via telework, but the employer’s operations did not previously allow for telework, or allowed for only minimal telework, then some adjustment period is expected, and, generally, the employer’s operations are not considered partially suspended during that period. However, if an employer incurs a significant delay (for example, beyond 2 weeks) in moving operations to comparable telework (for example, implementing telework policies or providing employees with equipment to telework), then the employer’s trade or business operations may be deemed subject to a partial suspension during that transition period. '}\n",
            "{'question': 'Question 17: If a governmental order requires an employer to close its workplace for certain purposes, but the workplace may remain operational for other limited purposes, is the employer considered to have a suspension of operations due to the governmental order? ', 'answer': 'Answer 17: If an employer’s workplace is closed due to a governmental order for certain purposes, but the employer’s workplace may remain open for other limited purposes, the employer’s operations would be considered to be partially suspended if, under the facts and circumstances, the operations that are closed are more than a nominal portion of its business operations and cannot be performed remotely in a comparable manner. If all, or all but a nominal portion, of an employer’s business operations may continue, but the operations are subject to modification due to a governmental order (for example, to satisfy distancing requirements), such a modification of operations is considered to be a partial suspension of business operations due to a governmental order if the modification required by the governmental order has more than a nominal effect on the business operations under the facts and circumstances. See Q/A 18 for a description of factors that may be used for determining if a modification required by a governmental order has more than a nominal effect on business operations. Example 1: Employer F, a restaurant business, must close its restaurant to on-site dining due to a governmental order closing all restaurants, bars, and similar establishments for sit-down service. Employer F is allowed to continue food or beverage sales to the public on a carry-out, drive-through, or delivery basis. On-site dining is more than a nominal portion of Employer F’s business operations. Employer F’s business operations are considered to be partially suspended because, under the facts and circumstances, more than a nominal portion of its business operations—its indoor and outdoor dining service—is suspended due to the governmental order. Example 2: Same facts as Example 1, except that two months later, under a subsequent governmental order, Employer F is permitted to offer sit-down service in its outdoor space, but its indoor dining service continues to be closed. During this period, Employer F is allowed to operate only its outdoor sit-down and carry-out service in accordance with the order. Indoor dining is more than a nominal portion of Employer F’s business operations. Employer F’s business operations are considered to be partially suspended because, under the facts and circumstances, more than a nominal portion of its business operations – its indoor dining service – is suspended due to a governmental order. The following month, under a further governmental order, Employer F is permitted to offer indoor dining service, in addition to outdoor sit-down and carry-out service, provided that all tables in the indoor dining room must be spaced at least six feet apart. This spacing constraint has more than a nominal effect on Employer F’s business operations. During this period, even though Employer F resumed all categories of its business operations, Employer F’s business operations continue to be partially suspended because, under the facts and circumstances, the governmental order restricting its indoor dining service has more than a nominal effect on its operations. Example 3: Employer G, a retail business, must close its retail storefront locations due to a governmental order. The retail business also maintains a website through which it continues to fulfill online orders; the retailer’s online ordering and fulfillment system is unaffected by the governmental order. The retail storefront locations are more than a nominal portion of Employer G’s business operations. Employer G’s business operations are considered to have been partially suspended due to the governmental order requiring it to close its retail storefront locations, which are more than a nominal portion of its business operations. Example 4: Employer H, a hospital, is considered to be operating an essential business under a governmental order with respect to its emergency department, intensive care, and other services for conditions requiring urgent medical care. However, the governmental order treats Employer H’s elective and non-urgent medical procedures as non-essential business operations and prevents Employer H from performing these services. Employer H suspends operations related to elective and non-urgent medical procedures, which are more than a nominal portion of Employer H’s business operations. Although Employer H is an essential business, Employer H is considered to have a partial suspension of operations due to the governmental order that prevents Employer H from performing elective and non-urgent medical procedures, which are more than a nominal portion of its business operations under the facts and circumstances. Example 5: Employer I, a grocery store, is considered to be operating an essential business under a governmental order. However, the governmental order requires grocery stores to discontinue their self-serve offerings, such as salad bars, though they may offer prepared or prepackaged food. Employer I modifies its operations to close its salad bar and other self-serve offerings and instead offers prepackaged salads and other items. The salad bar and other self-serve offerings are not more than a nominal portion of Employer I’s business operations. Further, the governmental order requiring Employer I to discontinue its self-serve offerings does not have more than a nominal effect on Employer I’s business operations under the facts and circumstances, even though Employer I was required to modify its business operations. Accordingly, Employer I’s business operations are not considered to be partially suspended due to a governmental order. Example 6: Employer J, a large retailer, is required to close its storefront location due to a governmental order, but is permitted to provide customers with curbside service to pick up items ordered online or by phone. The retail storefront location is more than a nominal portion of Employer J’s business operations. During this period, Employer J’s business operations are considered to have been partially suspended due to the governmental order requiring it to close its storefront location. Two months later, under a subsequent governmental order, Employer J is permitted to reopen its storefront location. Under the subsequent governmental order, however, Employer J must enforce social distancing guidelines that require Employer J to admit only a specified number of customers into the store per 1,000 square feet. While the governmental order results in customers waiting in line for a short period of time to enter the store during certain busy times of the week, the size of Employer J’s storefront is large enough that it is able to accommodate all of its customers after these short waits outside the store. The governmental order requiring Employer J to enforce social distancing guidelines does not have more than a nominal effect on Employer J’s business operations under the facts and circumstances, even though Employer J is required to modify its business operations. During this period, Employer J’s business operations are not considered to be partially suspended due to the governmental order because the governmental order requiring enforcement of social distancing guidelines does not have more than a nominal effect on its operations.

Examples of these modifications include: limiting occupancy to provide for social distancing, requiring services to be performed only on an appointment basis (for businesses that previously offered walk-in service), changing the format of service (for example, restrictions on buffet or self-serve, but not prepackaged or carry-out), or requiring employees and customers to wear face coverings. The mere fact that an employer must make a modification to business operations due to a governmental order does not result in a partial suspension unless the modification has more than a nominal effect on the employer’s business operations. Whether a modification required by a governmental order has more than a nominal effect on the business operations is based on the facts and circumstances. A governmental order that results in a reduction in an employer’s ability to provide goods or services in the normal course of the employer’s business of not less than 10 percent will be deemed to have more than a nominal effect on the employer’s business operations. For example, occupancy restrictions at a restaurant with indoor dining service may result in an actual, and more than nominal, reduction of the restaurant’s ability to service customers; however, an occupancy restriction at a retailer with sufficient physical space to accommodate its customers regardless of the restriction will likely not result in an actual, and more than nominal, reduction of the retailer’s ability to provide goods to its customers. Modifications altering customer behavior (for example, mask requirements or making store aisles one way to enforce social distancing) or that require employees to wear masks and gloves while performing their duties will not result in more than a nominal effect on the business operations.

An employer that reduces its operating hours due to a governmental order is considered to have partially suspended its operations since the employer’s operations have been limited by a governmental order. Example: Employer K operates a food processing facility that normally operates 24 hours a day. A governmental order issued by the local health department requires all food processing businesses to deep clean their workplaces once every 24 hours in order to reduce the risk of COVID-19 exposure. In order to comply with the governmental order, Employer K reduces its daily operating hours by five hours per day so that a deep cleaning may be conducted within its workplace once every 24 hours.

', 'answer': 'Answer 20: Yes. Employers that operate a trade or business in multiple locations and are subject to State and local governmental orders requiring full or partial suspension of operations in some, but not all, jurisdictions are considered to have a partial suspension of operations. Employers that operate a trade or business on a national or regional basis may be subject to governmental orders requiring closure of their locations in certain jurisdictions, but may not be subject to a governmental order in other jurisdictions. To operate in a consistent manner in all jurisdictions, these employers may establish a policy that complies with the local governmental orders, as well as the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) guidance; in this case, even though the employer may not be subject to a governmental order to suspend operations of its trade or business in certain jurisdictions, and may merely be following CDC or DHS guidelines in those jurisdictions, the employer would still be considered to have partially suspended operations due to the governmental orders requiring closure of its business operations in certain jurisdictions. Therefore, the employer would be an eligible employer with respect to all of its operations in all locations for calendar quarters during which the employer’s operations are partially suspended whether or not the employer voluntarily adopts consistent measures for its business operations in other jurisdictions. Example: Employer L is a national retail store chain with operations in every state in the United States. In some jurisdictions, Employer L is subject to a governmental order to close its stores to customers, but is permitted to provide customers with curbside service to pick up items ordered online or by phone. In these jurisdictions, Employer L determines that it is not continuing comparable operations and that the stores that are closed to customers are more than a nominal portion of its business operations. In other jurisdictions, Employer L is not subject to any governmental order to close its stores to customers or is considered an essential business permitting its stores to fully remain open. Employer L establishes a company-wide policy, in compliance with the local governmental orders and consistent with the CDC and DHS recommendations and guidance, requiring the closure of all stores and operating with curbside pick-up only, even in those jurisdictions where the business was not subject to a governmental order. As a result of the governmental orders requiring closure of Employer L’s stores to customers in certain jurisdictions, Employer L has a partial suspension of operations of its trade or business whether or not Employer L chooses to take consistent measures for stores in other jurisdictions. The partial suspension results in Employer L being an eligible employer nationwide for calendar quarters during which the employer’s operations are partially suspended. '}\n",

The period during which there is a significant decline in gross receipts ends with the earlier of January 1, 2021, or the calendar quarter that follows the first calendar quarter in which the employer’s 2020 quarterly gross receipts are greater than 80 percent of its gross receipts for the same calendar quarter in 2019 Example: Employer A’s gross receipts were $100,000, $190,000, and $230,000 in the first, second, and third calendar quarters of 2020, respectively. Its gross receipts were $210,000, $230,000, and $250,000 in the first, second, and third calendar quarters of 2019, respectively. Thus, Employer A’s 2020 first, second, and third quarter gross receipts were approximately 48 percent, 83 percent, and 92 percent of its 2019 first, second, and third quarter gross receipts, respectively. Accordingly, Employer A experienced a significant decline in gross receipts commencing on the first day of the first calendar quarter of 2020 (the calendar quarter in which gross receipts were less than 50 percent of those in the same quarter of 2019) and ending on the first day of the third calendar quarter of 2020 (the quarter following the first quarter in which the gross receipts were more than 80 percent of those in the same quarter of 2019).

Under the section 448(c) regulations, “gross receipts” means gross receipts of the taxable year and generally includes total sales (net of returns and allowances) and all amounts received for services. In addition, gross receipts include any income from investments, and from incidental or outside sources. For example, gross receipts include interest (including original issue discount and tax-exempt interest within the meaning of section 103 of the Code), dividends, rents, royalties, and annuities, regardless of whether those amounts are derived in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's trade or business. Gross receipts are generally not reduced by cost of goods sold, but are generally reduced by the taxpayer’s adjusted basis in certain property used in a trade or business or capital assets sold. Gross receipts do not include the repayment of a loan, or amounts received with respect to sales tax if the tax is legally imposed on the purchaser of the good or service, and the taxpayer merely collects and remits the sales tax to the taxing authority. \"}\n",

All entities that are treated as a single employer under the aggregation rules are treated as a single employer for purposes of determining whether the employer experienced a significant decline in gross receipts. To be an eligible employer on the basis of a significant decline of gross receipts, the employer must take into account the gross receipts of all members of the aggregated group. If the aggregated group does not experience a significant decline in gross receipts, then no member of the group may claim the employee retention credit on that basis. Example: Employer B and Employer C are members of a section 52(a) controlled group of corporations and are treated as a single employer under the aggregation rules. Because Employer B and Employer C are treated as a single employer under the aggregation rules, they must be treated as a single employer for purposes of determining whether there has been a significant decline in gross receipts. Neither Employer B nor Employer C is subject to a governmental order suspending business operations. Employer B has gross receipts of $1,000,000 in the second quarter of 2019 and $400,000 in the second quarter of 2020. Employer C has gross receipts of $1,000,000 in second quarter of 2019 and $750,000 in second quarter of 2020. Although Employer B’s gross receipts in the second quarter of 2020 were 40 percent of its 2019 second quarter gross receipts, neither Employer B nor Employer C can claim the employee retention credit due to a significant decline in gross receipts.

An employer that started its business in the second quarter of 2019 should use that quarter as the base period to determine whether it experienced a significant decline in gross receipts for the first two quarters in 2020 and should use the third and fourth quarters of 2019 for comparison to the third and fourth quarters of 2020, respectively, to determine whether it experienced a significant decline in gross receipts for those quarters. An employer that started its business in the third quarter of 2019 should use that quarter as the base period to determine whether it experienced a significant decline in gross receipts for the first three quarters in 2020 and should use the fourth quarter of 2019 for comparison to the fourth quarter of 2020 to determine whether it experienced a significant decline in gross receipts for that quarter. An employer that started its business in the fourth quarter of 2019 should use that quarter as the base period to determine whether it experienced a significant decline in gross receipts for any quarter in 2020. If an employer commenced business in the middle of a quarter in 2019, the employer should estimate the gross receipts it would have had for the entire quarter based on the gross receipts for the portion of the quarter that the business was in operation. To calculate this amount, the employer may use any reasonable method, including extrapolating the gross receipts for the quarter based on the gross receipts for the number of days its business was operating during the quarter.

Solely for purposes of the employee retention credit, when an employer compares its gross receipts for a 2020 calendar quarter when it owns an acquired business to its gross receipts for the same calendar quarter in 2019, the employer may, to the extent the information is available, include the gross receipts of the acquired business in its gross receipts for the 2019 calendar quarter. Under this safe harbor approach, the employer may include these gross receipts regardless of the fact that the employer did not own the acquired business during that 2019 calendar quarter. An employer that acquires a trade or business in the middle of a calendar quarter in 2020 and that chooses to use this safe harbor approach must estimate the gross receipts it would have had from that acquired business for the entire quarter based on the gross receipts for the portion of the quarter that it owned and operated the acquired business. However, an employer that chooses not to use this safe harbor approach is required to include only the gross receipts from the acquired business for the portion of the quarter that it owned and operated the acquired business.

Employer D has access to the books and records from the prior owner of the acquired trade or business and can determine the amount of gross receipts attributable to the trade or business for the quarter beginning January 1, 2019, and ending March 31, 2019. For purposes of the employee retention credit, Employer D must include $50,000 in its gross receipts computation for the quarter beginning January 1, 2020, and ending March 31, 2020 (because Employer D actually owned the trade or business) and may include $200,000 in its gross receipts computation for the quarter beginning January 1, 2019, and ending March 31, 2019.

The maximum amount of qualified wages (including allocable qualified health plan expenses) taken into account with respect to each employee for all calendar quarters in 2020 is $10,000, which means that the maximum credit for qualified wages (including allocable qualified health plan expenses) paid to any employee in 2020 is $5,000. If an employee is employed by two or more entities treated as a single employer under the aggregation rules, the maximum amount of qualified wages for all calendar quarters that may be taken into account with respect to that employee is $10,000 in the aggregate; thus, an aggregated group treated as a single employer may not claim more than the maximum credit of $5,000 with respect to any one individual employed by the members of the aggregated group. With respect to such an employee, the amount of the employee retention credit that may be claimed by any member of an aggregated group is based on the member’s proportionate share of qualified wages giving rise to the credit per the return period for which the credit is claimed. Example 1: Employer A is an eligible employer and pays $10,000 in qualified wages to Employee B in the second quarter of 2020. The employee retention credit available to Employer A for the qualified wages paid to Employee B is $5,000. Example 2: Employer C is an eligible employer and pays $8,000 in qualified wages to Employee D in the second quarter 2020 and $8,000 in qualified wages in the third quarter 2020. The credit available to Employer C for the qualified wages paid to Employee D is equal to $4,000 in the second quarter and $1,000 in the third quarter due to the overall limit of 50 percent of $10,000 of qualified wages per employee for all calendar quarters. Example 3: Employer E and Employer F are members of an aggregated group treated as a single employer and together are an eligible employer. Employee G is employed by both Employer E and Employer F. Employee G received $10,000 in qualified wages from each employer during the second quarter of 2020, for a total of $20,000. Because Employers E and F are treated as a single employer under the aggregation rules, the total amount of qualified wages that may be taken into account for determining the employee retention credit with respect to Employee G is limited to $10,000, and the maximum credit available for qualified wages paid to Employee G is $5,000. Employers E and F can claim their proportionate share of the $5,000 credit. Since Employers E and F paid equal amounts of qualified wages to Employee G, they can each claim $2,500. Additionally, because Employers E and F each paid the maximum amount of qualified wages ($10,000) to Employee G during the second quarter, Employers E and F are not entitled to the employee retention credit for wages paid to Employee G in any remaining quarter in 2020.

Employer A may treat as qualified wages the amounts its employees contribute as pre-tax salary reduction contributions to the qualified section 401(k) plan with respect to the period of the partial suspension of operations because those amounts are wages within the meaning of section 3121(a).

Only the amounts paid to employees for time they are not providing services, and at the rate of pay in effect prior to the increase, would be considered qualified wages. '}\n",
            "{'question': 'Question 36: May a large eligible employer treat the wages paid to hourly and non-exempt salaried employees for hours for which they are not providing services as qualified wages for purposes of the employee retention credit? ', 'answer': 'Answer 36: Yes, assuming the wages otherwise satisfy the requirements to be qualified wages. For a large eligible employer, wages paid to hourly and non-exempt salaried employees for hours that the employees were not providing services may be considered qualified wages for purposes of the employee retention credit. For an employee who does not have a fixed schedule of work, the hours for which the employee is not providing services may be determined using any reasonable method. The method that the large eligible employer would use to determine the employee’s entitlement to leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act would be a reasonable method for this purpose. Similarly, the method(s) that the Department of Labor has prescribed to determine the number of hours for which an employee with an irregular schedule is eligible for paid sick leave under the FFCRA would be considered reasonable for this purpose. It is not reasonable for the employer to treat an employee’s hours as having been reduced based on an assessment of the employee’s productivity levels during the hours the employee is working. Wages paid by a large eligible employer to its employees for hours for which they provided services are not considered qualified wages for purposes of the employee retention credit. Example 1: Employer G, a large eligible employer operating a manufacturing business, has several locations the operations of which are fully suspended during the second quarter of 2020 due to a governmental order. Employer G continues to pay hourly employees who are not providing services at the closed locations 50 percent of their normal hourly wage rates. Employer G also reduced headquarters’ administrative staff hours by 40 percent, but continues to pay them at 100 percent of their normal hourly wage rates. Employer G does not take the wages into account under sections 7001 and 7003 of the FFCRA. For employees who are not providing services due to the closure of their location, but are receiving 50 percent of their normal hourly wage rates, Employer G may treat the wages paid as qualified wages for purposes of the employee retention credit. For the administrative staff whose hours were reduced by 40 percent, but who are paid for 100 percent of the normal wage rate, Employer G may treat the 40 percent of wages paid for time that these employees are not providing services as qualified wages for purposes of the employee retention credit. The 60 percent of wages that Employer G pays the administrative staff for hours during which the employees are actually providing services is not considered qualified wages for purposes of the employee retention credit. Example 2: Employer H is a large eligible employer in the business of staging homes that are for sale. Employer H’s non-exempt salaried employees cannot perform their usual services of delivering and installing furniture to be used in staging houses because open houses are prohibited in its service area during the second quarter of 2020. However, the employees are required to provide Employer H with periodic status updates about furniture that has been leased out and other administrative matters. Employer H continues to pay wages to employees as if they continued to work their typical work hours even though the employees cannot provide their normal services. Using a reasonable method, Employer H has determined that its employees are working 20 percent of their typical work hours. Employer H does not take the wages into account under sections 7001 and 7003 of the FFCRA. Employer H may treat 80 percent of the wages paid as qualified wages for purposes of the employee retention credit. '}\n",
            "{'question': 'Question 37: May a large eligible employer treat wages paid to exempt salaried employees for time for which they are not providing services as qualified wages for purposes of the employee retention credit? ', 'answer': 'Answer 37: Yes, provided the wages paid to the exempt salaried employees are for the time that they are not providing services due to either a full or partial suspension of operations (due to a governmental order) or a significant decline in gross receipts. An eligible employer may use any reasonable method to determine the number of hours that a salaried employee is not providing services, but for which the employee receives wages either at the employee’s normal wage rate or at a reduced wage rate. Reasonable methods include the method (or methods) the employer uses to measure exempt employees’ entitlement to leave on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule under the Family and Medical Leave Act, or the method the employer uses to measure exempt employees’ entitlement to and usage of paid leave under the employer’s usual practices. It is not reasonable for the employer to treat an employee’s hours as having been reduced based on an assessment of the employee’s productivity levels during the hours the employee is working. Example 1: Employer I, a large eligible employer operating a fitness club business, closed all of its locations in City B due to a governmental order issued by City B’s mayor. Employer I continues to pay its exempt managerial employees their regular salaries. While the clubs are closed and there is not sufficient administrative work to occupy the managerial employees full-time, they continue to perform some accounting and similar administrative functions. Employer I has determined, based on the time records maintained by employees, that they are providing services for 10 percent of their typical work hours. Employer I does not take the wages into account under sections 7001 and 7003 of the FFCRA. In this case, 90 percent of wages paid to these employees during the period the clubs were closed are qualified wages. Example 2: Employer J, a large eligible employer operating a consulting firm, closed its offices due to various governmental orders and required all employees to telework. Although Employer J believes that some of its employees may not be as productive while working remotely, employees are working their normal business hours. Because employees’ work hours have not changed, no portion of the wages paid to the employees by Employer J are qualified wages. '}\n",

These wages are paid pursuant to existing leave policies that represent benefits accrued during a prior period in which the employees provided services and are not wages paid for time in which the employees are not providing services. However, a small eligible employer may treat all wages paid with respect to employees during the period of the full or partial suspension of operations or a calendar quarter in which it has a significant decline in gross receipts, even if under a pre-existing vacation, sick and other leave policy, as qualified wages for purposes of the employee retention credit, assuming the wages are not taken into account under sections 7001 and 7003 of the FFCRA.

', 'answer': 'Answer 39: Payments, including severance payments or other post-termination payments, made to a former employee following termination of employment are not considered qualified wages for purposes of the employee retention credit. Payments may be considered qualified wages only if the payments are made to an employee while employed by the eligible employer. Payments made in connection with a former employee’s termination of employment are not qualified wages because they are payments for the past employment relationship and thus are not payments made with respect to an employee during the time for which the employee retention credit may be claimed. Whether an employee has terminated employment is based on all of the facts and circumstances, including whether the employer has treated the employment relationship as terminated for purposes other than the continuation of wage payments.

Small eligible employers may treat health plan expenses allocable to the applicable periods as qualified wages even if the employees are not working and the eligible employer does not pay the employees any wages for the time they are not working. Example 1: Employer A is a small eligible employer subject to a governmental order that partially suspends the operation of its trade or business.

', 'answer': 'Answer 43: The qualified health plan expenses are determined separately for each plan. For each plan, those expenses are allocated to the employees who participate in that plan.

            "{'question': 'Question 44: For an eligible employer that sponsors a fully-insured group health plan, how are the qualified health plan expenses of that plan allocated on a pro rata basis? ', 'answer': 'Answer 44: An eligible employer who sponsors a fully-insured group health plan may use any reasonable method to determine and allocate the plan expenses, including (1) the COBRA applicable premium for the employee typically available from the insurer, (2) one average premium rate for all employees, or (3) a substantially similar method that takes into account the average premium rate determined separately for employees with self-only and other than self-only coverage. If an eligible employer chooses to use one average premium rate for all employees, the allocable amount for each day an employee covered by the insured group health plan is entitled to qualified wages could be determined using the following steps: (1) The eligible employer’s overall annual premium for the employees covered by the policy is divided by the number of employees covered by the policy to determine the average annual premium per employee. (2) The average annual premium per employee is divided by the average number of work days during the year for all covered employees (treating days of paid leave as a work day and a work day as including any day on which work is performed) to determine the average daily premium per employee. For example, a full-year employee working five days per week may be treated as working 52 weeks x 5 days or 260 days. Calculations for part-time and seasonal employees who participate in the plan should be adjusted as appropriate. Eligible employers may use any reasonable method for calculating work days for part-time and seasonal employees. (3) The resulting premium should be adjusted to reflect any portion that employees contribute after-tax. (4) The resulting amount is the amount allocated to each day of qualified wages. Example: Employer F sponsors an insured group health plan that covers 400 employees, some with self-only coverage and some with family coverage. Each employee is expected to have 260 work days a year (i.e., five days a week for 52 weeks). The employees contribute a portion of their premium by pre-tax salary reduction, with different amounts for self-only and family coverage. The total annual premium for the 400 employees is $5.2 million (this includes both the amount paid by the eligible employer and the amounts paid by employees through salary reduction). For an eligible employer using one average premium rate for all employees, the average annual premium rate is $5.2 million divided by 400, or $13,000. For each employee expected to have 260 work days a year, this results in a daily average premium rate equal to $13,000 divided by 260, or $50. This $50 is the amount of qualified health plan expenses allocated to each day of qualified wages per employee. '}\n",

If the eligible employer uses a reasonable actuarial method to determine the estimated annual expenses of the plan, then rules similar to the rules for insured plans are used to determine the amount of qualified health plan expenses allocated to an employee. That is, the estimated annual expense is divided by the number of employees covered by the plan, and that amount is divided by the average number of work days during the year for all covered employees (treating days of paid leave as work days and any day on which an employee performs any work as a work day).

As originally enacted, section 2301(j) of the CARES Act provided that an employer that received a PPP loan would not be eligible for the employee retention credit. With the elimination of this provision, an eligible employer is no longer prohibited from both claiming the employee retention credit and receiving a PPP loan. under the PPP. See section 7A(a)(12) of the Small Business Act, as amended by section 206(c)(1) of the Relief Act. Section 2301(g)(1) of the CARES Act, as amended by the Relief Act, permits an eligible employer to elect not to take into account certain qualified wages for purposes of the employee retention credit. An eligible employer generally makes the election by not claiming the employee retention credit for those qualified wages on its federal employment tax return. However, an eligible employer that received a PPP loan is deemed to have made the election under section 2301(g)(1) of the CARES Act for those qualified wages included in the amount reported as payroll costs on a Paycheck Protection Program Loan Forgiveness Application (PPP Loan Forgiveness Application). Specifically, the amount for which the eligible employer is deemed to have made the election is the amount of qualified wages included in the payroll costs reported on the PPP Loan Forgiveness Application up to (but not exceeding) the minimum amount of payroll costs, together with any other eligible expenses reported on the PPP Loan Forgiveness Application, sufficient to support the amount of the PPP loan that is forgiven. The employee retention credit does not apply to the qualified wages for which the election or deemed election is made. An eligible employer is not deemed to have made an election for any qualified wages paid by the eligible employer that are not included in the payroll costs reported on the PPP Loan Forgiveness Application. Notwithstanding a deemed election, if an eligible employer reports any qualified wages as payroll costs on a PPP Loan Forgiveness Application to obtain forgiveness of the PPP loan amount, but the loan amount is not forgiven by reason of a decision under section 7A(g) of the Small Business Act, those qualified wages may subsequently be treated as subject to section 2301 of the CARES Act and may be taken into account for purposes of the employee retention credit. If an eligible employer obtains forgiveness of only a portion of the PPP loan amount, then the employer is deemed to have made an election for the minimum amount of qualified wages included in the payroll costs reported on the PPP Loan Forgiveness Application necessary to obtain the forgiveness of that amount of the PPP loan. Example 1: Employer A received a PPP loan of $100,000. Employer A is an eligible employer and paid $100,000 in qualified wages that would qualify for the employee retention credit during the second and third quarters of 2020. In order to receive forgiveness of the PPP loan in its entirety, Employer A was required, under the Small Business Administration (SBA) rules, to report a total of $100,000 of payroll costs and other eligible expenses (and a minimum of $60,000 of payroll costs). Employer A submitted a PPP Loan Forgiveness Application and reported the $100,000 of qualified wages as payroll costs in support of forgiveness of the entire PPP loan. Employer A received a decision under section 7A(g) of the Small Business Act in the first quarter of 2021 for forgiveness of the entire PPP loan amount of $100,000. Employer A is deemed to have made an election not to take into account $100,000 of the qualified wages for purposes of the employee retention credit, which was the amount of qualified wages included in the payroll costs reported on the PPP Loan Forgiveness Application up to (but not exceeding) the minimum amount of payroll costs, together with any other eligible expenses reported on the PPP Loan Forgiveness Application, sufficient to support the amount of the PPP loan that is forgiven.

', 'answer': \"Answer 50: An eligible employer claims the employee retention credit for qualified wages by reporting its qualified wages and the amount of the credit to which it is entitled on the designated lines of its federal employment tax return(s). Employers also report any qualified sick leave wages and qualified family leave wages and claim the credit under sections 7001 or 7003 of the FFCRA on the designated lines on their federal employment tax returns. For most employers, Form 941 is used to report income and social security and Medicare taxes withheld by the employer from employee wages, as well as the employer's share of social security and Medicare tax. In anticipation of receiving the employee retention credit, eligible employers can (1) reduce their deposits of federal employment taxes, including withheld taxes, that would otherwise be required up to the amount of the anticipated credit, and (2) request an advance of the amount of the anticipated credit that exceeds the reduced federal employment tax deposits by filing Form 7200. Example: Employer A paid $10,000 in qualified wages (including allocable qualified health plan expenses), among other wages. After deferral of the employer's share of social security tax under section 2302 of the CARES Act, Employer A is otherwise required to deposit $8,000 in federal employment taxes for all of its employees for all wage payments made during the same quarter as the $10,000 in qualified wages. Employer A did not choose to use the relief under Notice 2020-65 to defer the employee’s share of social security tax. Employer A has no credits under sections 7001 and 7003 of the FFCRA. Employer A is not a tax-exempt organization eligible for the credit under section 303(d) of the Relief Act. In anticipation of the employee retention credit, Employer A may keep up to $5,000 of the $8,000 of taxes Employer A was otherwise required to deposit, and it will not owe a failure to deposit penalty for keeping the $5,000. Employer A will later account for the $5,000 it retained when it files Form 941 for the quarter. \"}\n",
            "{'question': 'Question 51: Can an eligible employer receive an advance payment of the employee retention credit if the eligible employer does not have sufficient federal employment taxes set aside for deposit to cover the amount of the anticipated credit? ', 'answer': \"Answer 51: Yes. If an eligible employer does not have sufficient federal employment taxes set aside for deposit to cover the amount of the anticipated credit, the eligible employer may request an advance payment of the credit. The amount of the advance payment will depend on the application of other relief provisions to the employer. For example, eligible employers are permitted to defer the deposit and payment of the employer's share of social security tax under section 2302 of the CARES Act and the employee’s share of social security tax under Notice 2020-65 and may do so prior to reducing any deposits in anticipation of the credit. Therefore, assuming an employer defers deposit of social security tax under section 2302 of the CARES Act and Notice 2020-65, the employer should take into account any permitted reduction in employment tax deposits due to (1) deferral under section 2302 of the CARES Act, (2) deferral under Notice 2020-65, (3) any anticipated credits under sections 7001 and 7003 of the FFCRA related to qualified sick leave wages and qualified family leave wages that the employer paid, and (4) for any tax-exempt organization employer, any credit under section 303(d) of the Relief Act, before determining the amount that it should request as an advance payment of the employee retention credit. If the remaining employment tax deposits set aside are less than the anticipated credit for the qualified wages, the eligible employer can file a Form 7200 to request an advance payment of the credit for the remaining amount of the anticipated credit. If an eligible employer fully reduces its required deposits of federal employment taxes otherwise due on wages paid in anticipation of receiving the credit, and that reduction covers the full amount of the anticipated credit, it should not file a Form 7200. Example: Employer B paid $20,000 in qualified wages to two employees (each employee was paid $10,000 in qualified wages) and is therefore entitled to a credit of $10,000. Employer B is otherwise required to deposit $8,000 in federal employment taxes on all wages paid to all employees, after deferring its employer's share of social security tax under section 2302 of the CARES Act. Employer B did not choose to use the relief under Notice 2020-65 to defer the employee’s share of social security tax. Employer B has no credits under sections 7001 and 7003 of the FFCRA. Employer B is not a tax-exempt organization eligible for the credit under section 303(d) of the Relief Act. Employer B can keep the entire $8,000 of taxes that Employer B was otherwise required to deposit without penalty as a portion of the credit it is otherwise entitled to claim on the Form 941. Employer B may make a request for an advance payment of the credit for the remaining $2,000 by submitting Form 7200. \"}\n",

An eligible employer may file a claim for refund or make an interest-free adjustment by filing Form 941-X, Adjusted Employer’s Quarterly Federal Tax Return or Claim for Refund, for a past calendar quarter to claim the employee retention credit to which it was entitled on qualified wages paid in that past calendar quarter, following the rules and procedures for making those claims or adjustments. An eligible employer that received a PPP loan and did not claim the employee retention credit may file a Form 941-X for the relevant calendar quarters in which the employer paid qualified wages, but only for qualified wages for which no deemed election was made.

A special fourth quarter rule, provided by section 206(e)(2) of the Relief Act, is also available for any qualified wages paid in the second or third quarters of 2020 that were reported as payroll costs on a PPP Loan Forgiveness Application if the loan amount was not forgiven by reason of a decision under section 7A(g) of the Small Business Act. Example 1: Employer D is an eligible employer and paid qualified wages during the second quarter of 2020 but did not claim an employee retention credit on its second quarter 2020 Form 941. Employer D did not receive a PPP loan. If Employer D subsequently decides to claim the credit to which it is entitled for the second quarter of 2020, Employer D should file a Form 941-X for the previously filed second quarter 2020 Form 941 within the appropriate timeframe to make an interest-free adjustment or claim a refund. Employer D should not use a subsequent Form 941 to claim an employee retention credit for qualified wages paid in the second quarter of 2020. Example 2: Employer E received a PPP loan of $200,000. Employer E is an eligible employer and paid $250,000 of qualified wages that would qualify for the employee retention credit during the second quarter of 2020. Employer E submitted a PPP Loan Forgiveness Application and reported the $250,000 of qualified wages as payroll costs in support of forgiveness of the entire PPP loan. Employer E received a decision under section 7A(g) of the Small Business Act in the first quarter of 2021 for forgiveness of the entire PPP loan amount of $200,000. Employer E is not deemed to have made an election with respect to the excess $50,000 of qualified wages that are included in the payroll costs reported on the PPP Loan Forgiveness Application. Accordingly, Employer E may take into account the $50,000 of qualified wages for purposes of the employee retention credit. If Employer E decides to take the $50,000 into account to claim the credit to which it is entitled for 2020, Employer E should file a Form 941-X for the previously filed second quarter 2020 Form 941 within the appropriate timeframe to make an interest-free adjustment or claim a refund for the second quarter, as appropriate. Under these facts, Employer E should not use a subsequent Form 941 to claim an employee retention credit for qualified wages paid in the second quarter of 2020. Example 3: Same facts as Example 2, except that Employer E’s PPP loan is not forgiven by reason of a decision under section 7A(g) of the Small Business Act.

Although the COVID-19 pandemic is a “qualified disaster” for purposes of section 139, qualified wages are not excludible qualified disaster relief payments, because qualified wages are what an individual would otherwise earn as compensation, rather than payment or reimbursement of expenses incurred as a result of a qualified disaster.

If a common law employer is otherwise eligible to receive the employee retention credit, it is entitled to the credit, regardless of whether it uses a third-party payer (such as a reporting agent, payroll service provider, PEO, CPEO, or 3504 agent) to report and pay its federal employment taxes. The third-party payer is not entitled to the employee retention credit with respect to the wages it remits on the common law employer\\'s behalf (regardless of whether the third-party is considered an \"employer\" for other purposes of the Code). If a common law employer uses a third-party to file, report, and pay employment taxes, different rules will apply depending on the type of third-party payer the common law employer uses for claiming/reporting the employee retention credit. If an eligible common law employer uses a reporting agent to file its federal employment tax returns, the reporting agent will need to reflect the employee retention credit on the federal employment tax returns it files on the common law employer\\'s behalf. If an eligible common law employer uses a CPEO or a 3504 agent that received its designation as an agent by submitting Form 2678, Employer/Payer Appointment of Agent, to report its federal employment taxes on an aggregate Form 941, the CPEO or 3504 agent will report the employee retention credit on its aggregate Form 941 and Schedule R, Allocation Schedule for Aggregate Form 941 Filers, that it already files. An eligible common law employer can submit its own Form 7200 to claim the advance payment of the credit. The eligible common law employer will need to provide a copy of the Form 7200 to the CPEO or 3504 agent so the CPEO or 3504 agent can properly report the employee retention credit on the Form 941. If an eligible common law employer uses a non-certified PEO or other third-party payer (other than a CPEO or section 3504 agent that submitted Form 2678) that reports and pays the common law employer client’s federal employment taxes under the third-party’s Employer Identification Number (EIN), the PEO or other third-party payer will need to report the employee retention credit on an aggregate Form 941 and separately report the employee retention credit allocable to the common law employers for which it is filing the aggregate Form 941 on an accompanying Schedule R. The PEO or other third-party payer does not have to complete Schedule R with respect to any common law employer for which it is not claiming an employee retention credit. The eligible common law employer will need to provide a copy of any Form 7200 that it submitted for an advance payment of the credit to the PEO or other third-party payer so the PEO or other third-party payer can properly report the employee retention credit on the Form 941.

            "{'question': 'Q. What can cause a delay before the VPN Client appears, specifically when the \"Start Before Logon\" option is enabled? ', 'answer': 'A.  The VPN Client is in \"fall back\" mode. This contributes to the delay. Uninstall the VPN Client and remove the offending applications to allow startup without being in \"fall back\" mode. Then reinstall the VPN Client. '}\n",
            "{'question': 'Q. I need to understand the difference between ipsecdialer.exe and vpngui.exe. Why is vpngui.exe installed in STARTUP in my Windows XP but I still have to manually start ipsecdialer in order to reach my companies resources? And (apart from the size) these programs seem to trigger the same thing which is a VPN logon to my company network. ', 'answer': 'A.  The ipsecdialer.exe was the original launching mechanism for VPN Client 3.x. When the GUI was changed in the 4.x versions, a new executable called vpngui.exe was created. The ipsecdialer.exe file was carried forward in name only for backward compatibility and just launches the vpngui.exe. This is the reason you could see the difference in the file size. '}\n",
            "{'question': 'Q. Can I safely remove the startup VPN icon? Why is it needed? ', 'answer': 'A.  The VPN Client in the startup folder supports the \"Start Before Logon\" feature. If you do not use the feature, then you do not need it in the startup folder. '}\n",
            "{'question': 'Q. Why is \"user_logon\" added and not at the ipsecdialer.exe shortcut? What is the purpose of \"user logon\"? ', 'answer': 'A.  The \"Start Before Logon\" feature requires the \"user_logon\" but a normal launch of the VPN Client by the user does not need this. NAT/PAT Problems \\xa0 '}\n",
            "{'question': 'Q. I am experiencing problems with only one VPN Client (for releases 3.3 and earlier) being able to connect through a Port Address Translation (PAT) device. What can I do to alleviate this problem? ', 'answer': 'A.  There was a bug in several Network Address Translation (NAT)/PAT implementations that causes ports less than 1024 not to be translated. On the VPN Client 3.1, even with NAT transparency enabled, the Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) session uses UDP 512. The first VPN Client goes through the PAT device and keeps source port 512 on the outside. When the second VPN Client connects, port 512 is already in use. The attempt fails. '}\n",
            "{'question': 'Q. Can two laptops be connected with the VPN Client from the same location? ', 'answer': 'A.  Two clients can connect to the same head end from the same location as long as the clients are not both behind a device performing PAT such as a SOHO router/firewall. Many PAT devices can map ONE VPN connection to a client behind it, but not two. In order to allow two VPN clients to connect from the same location behind a PAT device, enable some sort of encapsulation such as NAT-T, IPSec over UDP, or IPSec over TCP at the head end . Generally, NAT-T or another encapsulation should be enabled if ANY NAT device is between the client and the head end. Miscellaneous \\xa0 '}\n",

Refer to  VPN Clients with Microsoft Routing Problems  for information about how to resolve this issue. '}\n",
            "{'question': 'Q. How can I tell if a VPN Client is connected to the VPN Concentrator? ', 'answer': 'A.
